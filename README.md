Rules of Connect Four
You will start as player One
You will take your go as player One
You will not be allowed to go in squares that are not at the bottom of the grid, or do not have a taken square under it
Once your go is taken and you did not win, It will be player Two's go
The gamer will continue until a winning combination of four is reached by player One or player Two, or until the grid is full and no winning combination was found.
